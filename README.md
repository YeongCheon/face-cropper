# Face Cropper

This document generated by LLM.

Face Cropper is a simple Rust command-line application that detects and crops faces from images. It uses the [rust_faces](https://crates.io/crates/rust_faces) library for face detection, along with other popular crates such as [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) for argument parsing, [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) for image processing, and [indicatif](https://crates.io/crates/indicatif) for progress indication.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Detects faces in images using the MTCNN algorithm.
- **Image Cropping:** Automatically crops each detected face from the image.
- **Directory & File Support:** Works with a single image file or an entire directory containing images.
- **Cross-Platform:** Automatically selects the appropriate provider based on the operating system (using Core ML on macOS and CPU inference on other systems).

## Requirements

- **Supported Image Formats:** The application supports common image formats including `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`, `tiff`, `webp`, and `avif`.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install face-cropper
```
